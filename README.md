# PID-Creator
A C++ application that creates Personal ID cards (PIDs) for students in a school in PDF format.

## Inspiration
After graduating from secondary school, I returned to work in there IT & Communications department as an intern. It so happened that their system which autogenerated ID cards for student broke down. It is unclear why they were unable to patch the system at the time but they decided to delegate the task of creating these ID cards for a small set of students (10 at the time) manually. In accordance with one of my favourite quotes, 
> "Why spend 2 hours doing manual work when you could spend 10 hours doing automating the process?"

I decided to create a program to automatically create PDFs with each ID card. Each PDF would include a QR code, the school's logo, and student details. Originally, the program was made using Google Sheet's AppScript but it was later recreated in C++ for performance reasons (and also because I like trying out new things ðŸ˜…).

## Features
- Reads data from a `.tsv` (Tab-Separated Values) file which is downloaded from the school's database (Example included in file directory).
- Displays file opening dialog (Windows) to allow easy selection of `.tsv` file
- Retrieves each student's QR code from a URL online where the school stores QR codes.
- Creates PDFs for each student using the free [libharu](https://github.com/libharu/libharu) library.
- Uses OOP principles to store student data after importing from `.tsv` file.

## Dependencies
The project depends on [libharu](https://github.com/libharu/libharu).
Relevant `dll` files have been included in the directory. These must be put in the same directory as the executable.
The folders, `Calibri` and `pictures`, must also be in the same directory as the executable.
The project also includes Windows libraries for the open file dialog box.
